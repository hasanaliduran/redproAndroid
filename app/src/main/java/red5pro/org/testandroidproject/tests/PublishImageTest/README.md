#Publish Image Capture

`R5Stream.getStreamImage` allows the user to capture a screenshot of the stream at any time.

###Example Code
- ***[PublishTest.java](../PublishTest/PublishTest.java)***
- ***[PublishImageTest.java](PublishImageTest.java)***

##Running the example
Touch the screen at any time while streaming to popup a temporary overlay containing the UIImage that is returned from the Red5 Pro SDK.

##Using getStreamImage
`R5Stream.getStreamImage` returns a UIImage containing a screenshot of the current stream. The image dimensions match the incoming stream dimensions, and contain RGB data. Once streaming, simply call:

```Java
Bitmap streamImage = publish.getStreamImage();
```

The UIImage can be saved to disk, displayed with a UIImageView, or processed in any way that is needed.
