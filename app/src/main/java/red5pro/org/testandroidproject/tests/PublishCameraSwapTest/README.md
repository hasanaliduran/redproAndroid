#Publish Camera Swap

`R5Camera.setCamera` allows the user to change the video source for a stream without interupting the broadcast.

###Example Code
- ***[PublishTest.java](../PublishTest/PublishTest.java)***
- ***[PublishCameraSwapTest.java](PublishCameraSwapTest.java)***

##Running the example
Touch the screen at any time while streaming to switch between broadcasting from the front facing and back facing camera.

##Using R5Camera.device
`R5Camera.setCamera` will allow you to hot-swap sources for the stream. Once streaming, simply call:

```Java
R5Camera publishCam = (R5Camera)publish.getVideoSource();
```
