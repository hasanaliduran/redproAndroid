#Subcriber Image Capture

`R5Stream.getStreamImage` allows the user to capture a screenshot of the stream at any time.

###Example Code
- ***[SubscribeTest.java](../SubscribeTest/SubscribeTest.java)***
- ***[SubscribeImageTest.java](SubscribeImageTest.java)***

##Running the example
Begin by publishing to **stream1** from a second device.  **stream1** is the default stream1 name that is used by this example. Select the **SubscribeStreamImageTest** option to open a subscriber view. 

Touch the screen at any time while streaming to popup a temporary overlay containing the UIImage that is returned from the Red5 Pro SDK.

##Using getStreamImage
`R5Stream.getStreamImage` returns a UIImage containing a screenshot of the current stream. The image dimensions match the incoming stream dimensions, and contain RGB data. Once streaming, simply call:

```Java
screenShot.setImageBitmap(subscribe.getStreamImage());
```

The UIImage can be saved to disk, displayed with a UIImageView, or processed in any way that is needed.
